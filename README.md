# racegame
a python / flask script that generates a horse racing tournament

example at http://horses.homingpigeon.racing - refresh to generate new games and statistics

words.py is just a list of random words to make horse names from - I watched some thing about race horses and the goofy names inspired me to write a script to generate horse names, and it kind of winded it's way into this. The stats are basically pointless, horse races don't really work like this, but it's not suppose to be realistic anyway.
